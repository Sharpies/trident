Introduction
------------

A RuneScape Private Server Emulator based off of the 317 protocol.  We use netty 3.6.6 for our networking for our application since it's a library already designed.  We chose this because I had a hard time making a good flow for the Nio networking I use to have.  The server will be using SQL to store all data from players to items etc, etc.  We aim to make this a fast framework but still providing a decent platform for intermediate programmers who would like something a step under Apollo.  If you have any issues with the design please contact me via Mopar: Ares_ or Rune-Server: Ares_
