<p>We plan to make a bridge between Hyperion and Apollo.  We are striving to make it the 'middle' ground source basically it's a step below Apollo but a has higher performance then Hyperion already has.  I'm striving to create a great networking back for the server while keeping it simple for you to edit it freely. </p>

<a name="about-myself" class="anchor" href="#about-myself"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About myself</h3>

<p>I have been programming for about a year now, this is my 5th framework attempt after Sharpie which was pretty good in my honest opinion.  But with this I plan on doing the networking setup differently then I did when we wrote Sharpie.  I'm 17 years old and I program as a hobby nothing serious, I also wakeboard and party pretty often.</p>

<a name="documentation-for-the-application" class="anchor" href="#documentation-for-the-application"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Documentation For the application</h3>

<p>I plan on making it highly documented especially the login protocol, I want to help you understand how it all works so you aren't left feeling like you don't know what is going on with the networking if it were to have any flaws down the road. </p>
